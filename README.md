# elm-architecture-explain

In this README, ELM architecture is reviewed in the developer's way and explain the event flow sequence so that we can quickly align the business logic to the ELM event flow and architecture.

I try to compare with React.js in case of need so that the concept is explained more clearly if you are familiar with React.js framework.

## Overview

**ELM** is another web development framework like Facebook React and Google Angular but it is functional language like Haskell and super simple and pragmatic to the developers.

**ELM** is the result of the thesis of the genious young havard student **Evan Czaplicki**, which was published on 03/30/2012.

**ELM** offers you the best developer experience to enjoy concurrent FRP (Functional React Programming). If you like Mobx.js, you will love ELM.

**ELM** offers the developers the concurrent functional reactive programming (**FRP**) experience in the succinct and pragmatic way. The data immutability and virtual DOM strategy and two-tier codes optimiation make the compiled JS file super tiny in **size** and super speedy in **performance**.
